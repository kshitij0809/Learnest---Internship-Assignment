2. Backend Development Assignment:
Stack: Node.js

Build a login and signup module capturing basic details (Phone Number, Email, Name and DOB). Also add Facebook and Google Login / signup.

Once the user signups, show him a message - You've successfully signed up. Post signup, user should be able to login using the same credentials used. Show a message saying that you've successfully logged in. Host this server anywhere you wish to (AWS, Azure, Your own laptop etc). For DB, use whatever you're comfortable with (Mongo, NOSQL, MYSQL etc)

Moreover, in this assignment, think of use cases like Fraud login, multiple users from the same device, double authentication, etc. Think about how will you solve for these use cases and build the module accordingly.

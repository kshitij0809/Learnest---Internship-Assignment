1. Frontend Development Assignment:
Udacity is one of the leading ed-tech companies in the world. Visit their website (www.udacity.com). Your assignment is to make a clone of their homepage. Use the same assets (Images, graphics) available on the website.

You need to use React.js to build this. The major part of the homepage where React.js needs to be used is under "Choose your Category". You need to store all the courses under each category on the client side and then load the respective courses when the user chooses a particular category.

P.S.: You have to make the homepage only. It is not necessary for you to optimize it completely (Like exact hovering, Cross Browser optimization or mobile optimization) but optimizing such details will be a plus.
